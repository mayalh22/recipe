recipe website! (for fall) - made by maya hazarika

this is a recipe website with >60 recipes from breakfast to dessert

it has a live search function, a clean ui, a click to expand feature, and it works on desktop and mobile

each recipe has a title/dish name, list of required ingredients, and step by step instructions

i used html5, css3, and vanilla js

i think later on i might add tags/categories, images, randomizer
