Recipe viewer app by Maya Hazarika

This is a clean and responsive web app for browsing, searching, and selecting recipes. It uses serif fonts and earthly colors (brown and bold)/

I built this mostly for fun as my final (hopefully) Athena project to practice more front-end stuff with JS. For this project, I also focused on adding a buttload of code comments to be very clear (in script.js I used so many comments it’s basically translated to English). I did add some fun parts like ESC key handling. Thanks for checking this out!!!!!

- I usually never add comments at all - this time I added them like every other line. it helped me keep track of the structure, styling decisions, behaviors. Plus, it makes the code easier for anyone else who might want to use it
- If you are one of the few who skips commenting, I recommend giving it a try. It slows you down initially, but it pays off! It's sort of like showing your work during math tests. In a way...

It features:

- Recipe cards (clickable) showing recipe titles, clicking expands and collapses details
- Search functionality in real time, filtering recipes by title and content
- Show all button for resetting search and displaying all recipes
- Random recipe button, selecting and highlighting a random recipe
- Responsive design, working on mobile and desktop
- Smooth scrolling
- Keyboard accessibility — ESC key clears search and deselects recipes
- fully integrated comments section letting users share feedback (not using storage yet)

I used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS
