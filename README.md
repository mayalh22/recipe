recipe viewer app by maya hazarika

this is a clean and responsive web app for browsing, searching, and selecting recipes

- i built this mostly for fun as my final (hopefully) athena project to practice more front end stuff with js. this project, i also focused on adding a buttload of code comments to be very clear (in script.js i used so much comments its basically translated to english). i did add some fun parts like esc key handling. thanks for checking this out!!!!!

it features:

- recipe cards (clickable) showing recipe titles, clicking expands and collapses details
- search functionality in real time, filtering recipes by title and content
- show all button, for resettng search and displaying all recipes
- random recipe button, selecting and highlighting a random recipe
- responsive design, working on mobile and desktop
- smooth scrolling
- keyboard accesibility - esc key clears search and deselects recipes

i used:

- html5
- css3
- vanilla js
