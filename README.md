Recipe Viewer Site by Maya Hazarika

This is a clean and responsive web app for browsing, searching, and selecting recipes. It uses serif fonts and earthy colors (warm browns and golds).

I built this mostly for fun as my final (hopefully) Athena project to practice more front-end stuff with JavaScript. I also decided to do something very different:

- add a ton of comments

Usually, I skip commenting almost entirely. But this time, I added comments on basically every other line. It helped me keep track of the code’s structure, styling decisions, and behaviors. Plus, it makes the code way easier for anyone else who might want to read or use it.

If you’re like me and usually avoid comments, I recommend giving it a try. It slows you down at first, but it really pays off. It’s kind of like showing your work in a math test — super helpful in the long run!

Features:

- Clickable recipe cards showing recipe titles; clicking expands and collapses details
- Real-time search filtering recipes by title and content
- “Show All” button to reset search and show all recipes
- “Random Recipe” button to select and highlight a random recipe
- Responsive design, works on mobile and desktop
- Smooth scrolling for anchor navigation
- Keyboard accessibility — ESC key clears search and deselects recipes
- Fully integrated comments section letting users share feedback (not storing data yet)
- fun notes with every recipe - add ons or relevant info

Built Witch:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

Thanks for checking this out!
