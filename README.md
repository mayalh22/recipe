Recipe viewer app by Maya Hazarika

This is a clean and responsive web app for browsing, searching, and selecting recipes.

I built this mostly for fun as my final (hopefully) Athena project to practice more front-end stuff with JS. For this project, I also focused on adding a buttload of code comments to be very clear (in script.js I used so many comments it’s basically translated to English). I did add some fun parts like ESC key handling. Thanks for checking this out!!!!!

It features:

- Recipe cards (clickable) showing recipe titles, clicking expands and collapses details
- Search functionality in real time, filtering recipes by title and content
- Show all button for resetting search and displaying all recipes
- Random recipe button, selecting and highlighting a random recipe
- Responsive design, working on mobile and desktop
- Smooth scrolling
- Keyboard accessibility — ESC key clears search and deselects recipes

I used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS
